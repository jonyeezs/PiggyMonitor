## lesson\out-the-door

Not much lessons to be learnt here. Mostly we just using new tools and dirty experiments.

This iteration isn't perfect. In fact it is down right bad practices but it is the quickest code i can write to get work done.

It is laced with TODOs and FIXMEs.

Take this lesson as quick experimentation. Most notably the article-table.

This would be a good case where I can see how well I can refactor the code easily.
